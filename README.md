Summary 15/7
This project implements a CSV-to-JSON mapping interface. After uploading and mapping the CSV data to a JSON template, the frontend automatically validates the data based on required fields. Invalid entries are visually highlighted, allowing users to edit the values directly within the table. Once corrections are made, the updated CSV can be downloaded for further use.
